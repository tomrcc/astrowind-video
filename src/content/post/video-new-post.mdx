We have all at one time or another mixed some mud. Exercising the imagination, experimenting with talents, being creative; these things, to me, are truly the windows to your soul. A tree needs to be your friend if you're going to paint him.

I guess that would be considered a UFO. A big cotton ball in the sky. Put it in, leave it alone. Think about a cloud. Just float around and be there. You're the greatest thing that has ever been or ever will be. You're special. You're so very special.

There's nothing wrong with having a tree as a friend. Each highlight must have it's own private shadow. Clouds are free. They just float around the sky all day and have fun.

It's all a game of angles. It's cold, but it's beautiful. I sincerely wish for you every possible joy life could bring. I can't think of anything more rewarding than being able to express yourself to others through painting.

For the lack of a better word I call them hangy downs. Sometimes you learn more from your mistakes than you do from your masterpieces. Trees cover up a multitude of sins. If we're gonna walk though the woods, we need a little path.
